The Insertion Sort algorithm divides the array into a sorted part and an unsorted part.

* We assume the first item is already sorted, then we pick an unsorted item. If the unsorted item is greater than the item in hand, it goes to the right; otherwise, it goes to the left.
    
* We repeat this process, placing each unsorted item in its correct position.
    

**Explanation**

* **Outer Loop**: The outer loop starts at index 1 and goes through each element of the array.
    
* **Inner While Loop**: The while loop compares the current element (arr\[i\]) with the previous element (arr\[i-1\]). If the previous element is greater, they are swapped.
    
* **Decrement i**: After swapping, `i` is decremented to keep checking the current element against the elements to the left.
    

```python
def insertion_sort(array):
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        j = i
        while array[j - 1] > array[j] and j > 0:
            # Swap j-1 with j
            (array[j - 1], array[j]) = (array[j], array[j - 1])
            j -= 1


data = [23, 55, 12, 99, 66, 33]
insertion_sort(data)
print(data)  # [12, 23, 33, 55, 66, 99]
```
