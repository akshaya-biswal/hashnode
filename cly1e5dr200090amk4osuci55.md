## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes

Variable names are case-sensitive

```python
name = "Hello"
Name = "World"
name = 100
print(name)
```

### Casting

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting. but the type can be changed after wards

```python
x = str(3)  # '3'
y = int(3)  # 3
z = float(3)  # 3.0
```
