The data structure is called a "tree" because it looks like a tree, only upside down.

A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

## Types of Trees

**Binary Trees:** Each node can have up to two children: a left child and a right child. This structure is the base for more complex trees like Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees.

**Binary Search Trees (BSTs):** A type of Binary Tree where each node's left child has a lower value, and the right child has a higher value.

**AVL Trees:** A type of Binary Search Tree that keeps itself balanced. For every node, the height difference between the left and right subtrees is at most one. This balance is kept through rotations when nodes are added or removed.
